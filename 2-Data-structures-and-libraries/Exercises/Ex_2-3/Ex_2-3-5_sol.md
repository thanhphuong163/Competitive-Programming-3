# Exercise 2.3.5

## Description

Some (hard) problems require us to write our own balanced Bi- nary Search Tree (BST) implementations due to the need to augment the BST with additional data (see Chapter 14 of [7]). Challenge: Solve UVa 11849 - CD which is a pure balanced BST problem with your own balanced BST implementation to test its performance and correctness.
