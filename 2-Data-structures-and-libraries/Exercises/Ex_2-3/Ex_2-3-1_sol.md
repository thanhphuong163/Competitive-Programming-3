# Exercise 2.3.1

## Description

Someone suggested that it is possible to store the $key \rightarrow value$ pairs in a sorted array of structs so that we can use the $\mathcal{O}(logn)$ binary search for the example problem above. Is this approach feasible? If no, what is the issue?

## My Anwser

Yes, it is feassible. Because it's like binary search a sorted array of numbers.
