# Exercise 2.3.2

## Description

We will not discuss the basics of BST operations in this book. Instead, we will use a series of sub-tasks to verify your understanding of BST-related concepts. We will use Figure 2.2 as an initial reference in all sub-tasks except sub-task 2.

1. Display the steps taken by search(71), search(7), and then search(22).
2. Starting with an empty BST, display the steps taken by insert(15), insert(23),
insert(6), insert(71), insert(50), insert(4), insert(7), and insert(5).
3. Display the steps taken by findMin() (and findMax()).
4. Indicate the inorder traversal of this BST. Is the output sorted?
5. Display the steps taken by successor(23), successor(7), and successor(71).
6. Display the steps taken by delete(5) (a leaf), delete(71) (an internal node with one child), and then delete(15) (an internal node with two children).

## My Answer

Too easy, so I've done it on my notebook.
